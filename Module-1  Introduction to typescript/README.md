## ❓ What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is a structured, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft. It is a **superset of JavaScript**, meaning it includes all JavaScript syntax and features, with added static typing and advanced tools.

## 🌐 Where is TypeScript Used?

- TypeScript is popular for **server-side development** and **large-scale applications**.
- It uses **static typing** – without specifying the type of a variable, the code won’t run.
- This feature makes **error detection easy and reliable**.

## 🔍 Difference Between TypeScript & JavaScript

- **JavaScript:** Dynamic language; variable types are determined at runtime.
- **TypeScript:** Superset of JavaScript with **static typing**, catching errors before compilation.
- TypeScript code ultimately **compiles to JavaScript**, so it can run anywhere JS runs.
